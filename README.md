# Hello, I'm @Al.ortiztique 👋

I am Al.ortiztique, a Computer Science student. I have several formal certifications issued by institutions such as Harvard University, Stanford, and Google. My interest is in disruptive technologies and I chose the Data Science specialization path in order to apply this discipline to cybersecurity. I am passionate about cybersecurity and enjoy creating solutions that can positively impact an organization and the people it serves.

Also, I'm a passionate learner and innovator in artificial intelligence. I'm fascinated by the applications of AI in robotics, especially in the fields of health sciences, agriculture, aerospace and law.

My strengths include verbal and written communication, ethical hacking and project planning.

My values are based on protecting people, adhering to the law and speaking out against injustice.

My career goal is to work at a high profile company such as Google, Tesla or Microsoft in cybersecurity as part of a red team or offensive hacking.
